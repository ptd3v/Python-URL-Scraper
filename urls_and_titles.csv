/r/AskUK/comments/11wbli4/passed_my_driving_test_yesterday_pass_plus_doesnt/,Pretty much what the title says.I passed my driving test recently. Woo!I want to get my insurance down and ensure the safety of my children in the back of the car.Pass Plus is an expensive piece of paper that won’t get my insurance down. Most insurers won’t give a discount for it these days.Is there a proper advanced driving course I can take that will help me get my insurance down?Thanks in advance!
