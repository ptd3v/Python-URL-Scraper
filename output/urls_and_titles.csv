http://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/11xaies/i_stood_next_to_a_drunk_man_at_the_bus_stop_just/,"Standing in front all of us: “You’re all looking a bit dark there, with your navy jackets. Me? Look, I’ve got a yellow jacket.”To a woman: “Oh, nice pink scarf! If I had a scarf, I’d wear it.”In front of everyone again: “I admit it, I may be drunk, but I’m not an alcoholic. I am not an alcoholic.” But then he pulls out a big glass bottle of this brown stuff and another of what looked like whiskey.Pointing to cigarette on the ground: “Look, it’s just there! No one cares about it.”To the metal bench before leaving: “You were a very good chair!”"

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/11xead8/am_i_wrong_for_walking_out_of_a_job_interview/,"As title, I’m feeling conflicted about this.I went for an interview this morning for a local bakery. Interview scheduled for 10, I arrived at 9:50, went to reception and signed in etc. I was told they’d be with me in 5 minutes, they’re just getting prepared and all of that stuff. 5 minutes go by, nothing. 10 minutes go by, still nothing. I figured they’re interviewing someone else or that they’re running behind, no big deal.I’m then sitting waiting for 30 minutes with no one acknowledging my existence. Folk walking by constantly, including the receptionist who’s told me to wait. I happen to look at the wall, which has the first aid staff information as well as fire marshals, and notice that the guy who’s in charge of my interview is on there. The same guy who has walked by at least 3 times. It’s at this point I say enough is enough and sign myself out. It’s 10:35. No one has bothered to explain any delays, interviewer has blanked me several times despite knowing I’m sitting there waiting.Is this a dick move? The way I’m seeing this is that if I was 35 minutes late for the interview with no explanation as to why I’m late, I’d have no chance of getting the job. I’m also thinking if this is how badly their time management is, what will it be like actually working there? But I’m also thinking maybe i should’ve been more patient, and that it’s a bit unprofessional to walk out.What’s everyone’s thoughts? Am I right to walk out or should I have stuck it out?"
